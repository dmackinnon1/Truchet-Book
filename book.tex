\chapter*{Introduction}

\noindent
Truchet tiles are, traditionally, square tiles that are divided by a diagonal line, and coloured with two colours with a different colour on either side of the diagonal. Each tile can be rotated to one of four positions. Patterns are formed by placing tiles next to each other, often rotating tiles to create repeated motifs.
This booklet presents a complete listing of $4x4$ Truchet tile patterns with rotational symmetry (256 patterns). tiles\marginnote{\centering\input{tiles/tileList2.gtex}} Treating these 4x4 tile patterns as tiles themselves allows for larger decorative patterns to be built. Interesting relationships among the 4x4 tiles patterns and within the larger patterns created with them can be observed. 

\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent
Each $4x4$
Truchet tile pattern with rotational symmetry has a core $2x2$ pattern in one of its quadrants that is rotated to produce the overall pattern. \marginnote{\centering\input{positions}} In this booklet, the core pattern is assumed to be in the lower left. Each pattern can identified as a sequence of 4 digits $abcd$ that list the rotational positions of each tile in the lower left quadrant.

\chapter{Pattern families}

\noindent
We can group the 4x4 Truchet tile patterns with rotational symmetry into families where  tile patterns are considered to be in the same family if they would look the same without colour -- if each corresponding tile shares the same diagonal direction. The sequence that represents the family of a tile pattern can be found by taking the sequence of the tile pattern \textit{modulo} $2$. So, for example, the 16 tile patterns below are all members of the 0110 family.

\chapter{Friezes of Truchet patterns}

\noindent
Each 4x4 Truchet pattern can be treated like a tile and used in a larger pattern. A \textit{frieze} is a horizontal strip of the same tile pattern repeated. Friezes of 4x4 Truchet pattern tiles with rotational symmetry can be quite striking, and have some interesting characteristics. 

\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent
In frieze of more than one row of a primary tile reveals a secondary tile pattern that appears as another horizontal strip of 4x4 Truchet tile patterns nestled between the rows of primary tiles. Below, a frieze of 2223 tiles has a secondary pattern of 1000 tiles.

\input{sample_frieze}

\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent
Frieze patterns made from tiles of a particular family will have secondary tiles that also have rotational symmetry and that are from the same family. For example, frieze patters from the family 0001 will have secondary patterns from the family 1000. 
\marginnote{\centering\input{secondary_positions}} 

\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent
You can compute the secondary frieze tile pattern of a given tile by reversing the digits of the tile label and adding 2 to each digit, modulo 4. This is because the label of the secondary frieze tile pattern comes from the top right corner of the primary tile pattern. 

\vspace{0.5cm}
\noindent
If tile \textit{t} is the primary tile in a frieze pattern and \textit{s} is the secondary, then \textit{t} will be the secondary tile in the frieze pattern formed by \textit{s}. This effectively reduces the total number of unique frieze patterns to 136, these patterns are shown on the pages that follow.
