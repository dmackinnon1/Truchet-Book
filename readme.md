# Truchet Book

This booklet shows all 256 4x4 Truchet patterns with rotational symmetry.

This is a LaTeX learning project that uses 
- javascript to generate the patterns and the LaTeX code for each "tile family" page;
- the "Tufte book" class for formatting: https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/
