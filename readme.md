# Truchet Book

This booklet shows all 256 4x4 Truchet patterns with rotational symmetry.

This is a LaTeX learning project that uses 
- javascript to generate the patterns and the LaTeX code for each "tile family" page;
- the "Tufte book" class for formatting: https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/

The latex file to be compiled is book.tex. The files main.tex and the .gtex ("generated tex") files are created by running js/index.js.
